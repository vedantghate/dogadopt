        <p class="info">
            Indian Native Dogs/INDogs ( termed Pariahs by the Brits ) form the majority of the street dogs in India. They
            were probably the first domestic dogs of India as there is evidence which shows they were here at least
            11.000 years ago. Being a landrace breed they are completely free of the genetic defects which plague all
            the man-made breeds.
            They existed as community dogs. The concept of dogs as ' house pets ' was not known to the average Indian
            family till the late 20th century.
            Even today people still consider only foreign breeds to be ' real house pets '
            Indies were never really given a chance to prove that they could be good house pets too.
            But now we have proof--there are hundreds of happily adopted Indies all over India. I hope more and more
            people come forward to adopt these wonderful, smart and lovable dogs.<br/>
